# Diabetes-Prediction

# Description
In this project, we will be analysing a large number of machine learning models in order to be used in the field of Internet
of Medical Things (IoMT), specifically in the case of predicting diabetes mellitus (type 2 diabetes). Using the Pima
Indians Diabetes database in order to train and validate the models, we analyze the accuracy, precision, AUC and many
other metrics in order to evaluate the best working model for the task in hand. This project shows the significance
of machine learning in healthcare and predicive analysis, and can act as a secondary opinion to provide assistance to
workers of the medical field.
